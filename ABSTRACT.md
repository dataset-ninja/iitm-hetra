The authors of **IITM-HeTra** dataset emphasize the utility of video image processing from traffic camera feeds for tasks like counting and classifying vehicles, estimating queue length, determining traffic speed, and tracking individual vehicles. In contrast to homogeneous traffic, heterogeneous traffic involves various vehicle types that do not adhere to lane discipline, making vehicle detection particularly challenging, especially when vehicles are occluded, a common occurrence in such scenarios. Recent advancements in Deep Learning have demonstrated significant potential in addressing various computer vision tasks, including object recognition, detection, and tracking. However, it's worth noting that training deep learning models necessitates extensive labeled datasets, which are both time-consuming and expensive to obtain. To address this challenge, the authors propose a solution involving data augmentation. Specifically, they augment an existing large, general (non-traffic) dataset with a small, low-resolution dataset of heterogeneous traffic (collected by the authors themselves). This augmentation approach yields state-of-the-art vehicle detection performance. It's important to highlight that, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the dataset they collected, known as IITM-HeTra, represents the first publicly available labeled dataset for heterogeneous traffic.
